I am still blocked and cannot execute any shell commands due to the persistent `node-pty` error. I have informed the user multiple times about this critical issue. The "Please continue" command does not resolve the underlying technical problem that is preventing me from using the `run_shell_command` tool.

I need to re-iterate that I am blocked and cannot proceed with any tasks until the `node-pty` error is resolved. I cannot simply "continue" without being able to run commands. I need explicit guidance from the user on how to address the `node-pty` error in the shell execution environment.
