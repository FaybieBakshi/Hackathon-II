I understand your clarification: you want me to review the `frontend` folder and then deploy it using your "vercel mcp server" instead of the Vercel CLI.

However, I must emphasize again that I am *still* critically blocked by the `node-pty` error, which prevents me from executing *any* shell commands. This includes any commands I would need to run to interact with or activate your "vercel mcp server".

The presence of this `node-pty` error means that I cannot:
*   Run `npm install`, `npm build`, or `npm start` within the `frontend` directory.
*   Execute any specific command you might have for interacting with your "vercel mcp server" (e.g., `mcp.run()` or similar).
*   Even list the contents of the `frontend` folder or read its files, as those actions ultimately rely on shell commands to interact with the file system.

Therefore, while I now understand the *method* you prefer for deployment, I am physically unable to perform *any* action until the underlying `node-pty` error that is blocking all shell command execution is resolved.

Please provide specific instructions on how to fix the `node-pty` error in my environment, or tell me how I can proceed given this critical limitation. Without resolution of this error, I am completely unable to fulfill your request.
