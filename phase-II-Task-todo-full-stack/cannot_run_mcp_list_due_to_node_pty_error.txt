I understand you would like me to run `/mcp list` to see the available tools. However, I am still unable to execute any shell commands, including `/mcp list`, due to the critical `node-pty` error mentioned previously: "The @lydell/node-pty package supports your platform (win32-x64), but it could not find the binary package for it: @lydell/node-pty-win32-x64/conpty.node".

This fundamental issue prevents me from running any commands. Until this `node-pty` error is resolved in the environment, I cannot proceed with `/mcp list` or any other tasks requiring shell execution.

Please resolve the `node-pty` error in your environment.
