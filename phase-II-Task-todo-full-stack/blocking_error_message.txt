I understand your request to review the `frontend` folder and deploy it to Vercel using the "Vercel MCP server."

However, I am *still* encountering a critical `node-pty` error that prevents me from executing *any* shell commands. This includes commands needed to:
1.  **Review the `frontend` folder:** I cannot list files, read file contents, or analyze the project structure.
2.  **Deploy to Vercel:** Any deployment process, whether through a CLI or an MCP server (if it relies on underlying shell commands), is currently blocked.

The specific error message is: "The @lydell/node-pty package supports your platform (win32-x64), but it could not find the binary package for it: @lydell/node-pty-win32-x64/conpty.node".

This is an environmental issue that must be resolved by you before I can proceed with *any* tasks requiring shell command execution.

Please resolve the `node-pty` error in your environment. Once it's fixed, I can then proceed with reviewing the frontend and attempting the deployment as you requested.
